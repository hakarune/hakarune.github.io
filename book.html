Love: The unrelenting, forgiving, and acceptance of another in all their choices and life. As well as wanting nothing but the best for them, even at the sacrifice of one’s own happiness. It is the power to always forgive and look past the mistakes of the past and only strive for the future.<o:p></o:p></div>

Shakespeare once wrote,&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; text-indent: .75in;">
"Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown."</div>

People since then have grossly misquoted this to be, "Heavy is the head that wears the crown." Regardless the mistake the meaning is still the same and inlaid into this heavy verse. The one thing I have yet to see is any understanding of the term "crown." Obviously in the exact literal sense the king is of course referring to himself, yet we all know Shakespeare; some know him better than others of course. Shakespeare was never so literal in anything by any sense. So here I think I have deciphered the meaning of the term. What is a crown; it cannot be just a physical, knowing Shakespeare it has to have a metaphysical, or rather a metaphorical state. To not include such a thought is to shame the work of Shakespeare and to not see the meaning of this quote.</div>

Does not a father wear a crown for his family as well? Most off than not, the father is a hero and idolized by his children, looked to for support from the wife in her physical and emotional needs. Is this not a crown worthy of notion? In an ever changing world the same has always fallen upon the man to be the rock, to be the pillars that hold up the family. A father that struggles day to day to bring home enough money to support, shelter, and feed his own family. The father that works two or more jobs to accomplish does he not wear that crown?<o:p></o:p></div>

Now what of the person who values the lives of friends and family over his own, that person who will sacrifice everything for those he loves. He sacrifices his happiness and well being for the sake of making sure the lives of the people he loves are reach their dreams and are happy. This Person to me wears a greater crown than all others. He is nothing short of doomed in his life, the self sacrifice of his own dreams, happiness, love, and life for his family and friends who he loves. He who wears this crown above all else is living a life of no regrets or remorse, though worse yet they are the ones who forever live in constant sadness and never feel complete in life. He who cares so much and is willing to give up everything for the ones he loves, to me that is a great person to admire. Admiration is given based on the reality that among all of this, the ones he loves will never notice he does this and will live in constant ignorance of this fact and treat him as nothing more and nothing less than that of a good friend. None notice his sacrifices in all he does, never seeing his sadness or endless anguish.<o:p></o:p></div>

What type of person can live a life like this is what I asked myself. Why would they do it? I pondered in thought of how someone could. I thought hard and realized something, there are people of honorable notion that lived this way; Gandhi, Buddha, and of course the most infamous, Jesus. All of them thought nothing of themselves or their own happiness, instead always focused on helping others and helping them up. Showing love to so many, these men were surely remembered, yet there are many that live this way, though none are in the same way as grand. To me that is a dilemma, ones that do it so large everyone notices them, yet your neighbor could be the exact same as these great men, but none see him or his pain. Instead of seeing his pain behind the smile everyone moves on unconcerned. None recognize him for these great deeds, instead more oft than not he is taken advantage of. They see his kindness and constantly ask for more, chipping away more and more from a person that gives so much and asks for nothing in return.<o:p></o:p></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; tab-stops: .5in; text-indent: .5in;">Uneasy lies the head that wears this crown, a life living in apathy or a false blissful happiness of a mask worn for everyone else’s benefit. How can one live this way I still find myself saying, but then maybe they can't choose, there is no choice. This is innate in them, they worn born to be this way and they cannot live another way....</div>
